        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter introduces key Python packages and data structures for working with the two major types of spatial data, namely:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **shapely** and **geopandas** --- for working with vector layers\n",
        "* **rasterio** and **xarray** --- for working with rasters\n",
        "\n",
        "As we will see in the code chunks presented later in this chapter, **shapely** and **geopandas** are related:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **shapely** is a \"low-level\" package for working with individual vector geometry objects\n",
        "* **geopandas** is a \"high-level\" package for working with geometry columns (`GeoSeries` objects), which internally contain **shapely** geometries, and vector layers (`GeoDataFrame` objects)\n",
        "\n",
        "The **geopandas** ecosystem provides a comprehensive approach for working with vector layers in Python, with many packages building on it.\n",
        "This is not the case for raster data, however: there are several partially overlapping packages for working with raster data, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. \n",
        "In this book we focus on the two most prominent ones:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **rasterio** --- a spatial-oriented package, focused on \"simple\" raster formats (such as GeoTIFF), representing a raster using a combination of a `numpy` array, and a metadata object (`dict`) specifying the spatial referencing of the array\n",
        "* **xarray** --- A general-purpose package for working with labeled arrays, thus advantageous for processing \"complex\" raster format (such as NetCDF), representing a raster using its own native classes, namely `xarray.Dataset` and `xarray.DataArray`\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter will briefly explain the fundamental geographic data models: vector and raster. \n",
        "Before demonstrating their implementation in Python, we will introduce the theory behind each data model and the disciplines in which they predominate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The vector data model represents the world using points, lines, and polygons. \n",
        "These have discrete, well-defined borders, meaning that vector datasets usually have a high level of precision (but not necessarily accuracy).\n",
        "<!-- , as we will see in Section ...). (TODO add section cross reference) -->\n",
        "The raster data model divides the surface up into cells of constant size.\n",
        "Raster datasets are the basis of background images used in web-mapping and have been a vital source of geographic data since the origins of aerial photography and satellite-based remote sensing devices.\n",
        "Rasters aggregate spatially specific features to a given resolution, meaning that they are consistent over space and scalable (many worldwide raster datasets are available).\n",
        "\n",
        "Which to use? The answer likely depends on your domain of application, and the datasets you have access to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Vector datasets and methods dominate the social sciences because human settlements and and processes (e.g. transport infrastructure) tend to have discrete borders\n",
        "* Raster datasets and methods dominate many environmental sciences because of the reliance on remote sensing data\n",
        "\n",
        "There is much overlap in some fields and raster and vector datasets can be used together: ecologists and demographers, for example, commonly use both vector and raster data. \n",
        "Furthermore, it is possible to convert between the two forms\n",
        "<!-- TODO: (see Section ...).  -->\n",
        "Whether your work involves more use of vector or raster datasets, it is worth understanding the underlying data models before using them, as discussed in subsequent chapters. \n",
        "This book focusses on approaches that build on **geopandas** and **rasterio** packages to work with vector data and raster datasets, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Vector data\n",
        "\n",
        "The geographic vector data model is based on points located within a coordinate reference system (CRS). \n",
        "Points can represent self-standing features (e.g., the location of a bus stop), or they can be linked together to form more complex geometries such as lines and polygons. \n",
        "Most point geometries contain only two dimensions (3-dimensional CRSs contain an additional $z$ value, typically representing height above sea level).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this system, London, for example, can be represented by the coordinates `(-0.1, 51.5)`. \n",
        "This means that its location is -0.1 degrees east and 51.5 degrees north of the origin.\n",
        "The origin, in this case, is at 0 degrees longitude (the Prime Meridian) and 0 degree latitude (the Equator) in a geographic ('lon/lat') CRS.\n",
        "<!-- TODO: (Figure ..., left panel). -->\n",
        "The same point could also be approximated in a projected CRS with 'Easting/Northing' values of `(530000, 180000)` in the British National Grid, meaning that London is located 530 $km$ East and 180 $km$ North of the origin of the CRS. \n",
        "<!-- This can be verified visually: slightly more than 5 'boxes' --- square areas bounded by the gray grid lines 100 $km$ in width --- separate the point representing London from the origin. -->\n",
        "<!-- TODO: (Figure 2.1, right panel). -->\n",
        "The location of National Grid's origin, in the sea beyond South West Peninsular, ensures that most locations in the UK have positive Easting and Northing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- There is more to CRSs, as described in Sections ... and ... but, for the purposes of this section, it is sufficient to know that coordinates consist of two numbers representing the distance from an origin, usually in $x$ then $y$ dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "...\n",
        "FIGURE ...: Illustration of vector (point) data in which location of London (the red X) is represented with reference to an origin (the blue circle). \n",
        "The left plot represents a geographic CRS with an origin at 0Â° longitude and latitude. \n",
        "The right plot represents a projected CRS with an origin located in the sea west of the South West Peninsula. -->\n",
        "\n",
        "**geopandas** provides classes for geographic vector data and a consistent command-line interface for reproducible geographic data analysis in Python.\n",
        "**geopandas** provides an interface to three mature libraries for geocomputation which, in combination, represent a strong foundation on which many geographic applications (including QGIS and R's spatial ecosystem) builds:\n",
        "\n",
        "*  GDAL, for reading, writing, and manipulating a wide range of geographic data formats, covered in Chapter 8\n",
        "*  PROJ, a powerful library for coordinate system transformations, which underlies the content covered in Chapter 7\n",
        "*  GEOS, a planar geometry engine for operations such as calculating buffers and centroids on data with a projected CRS, covered in Chapter 5\n",
        "\n",
        "Tight integration with these geographic libraries makes reproducible geocomputation possible: an advantage of using a higher level language such as Python to access these libraries is that you do not need to know the intricacies of the low level components, enabling focus on the methods rather than the implementation.\n",
        "This section introduces **geopandas** classes in preparation for subsequent chapters (Chapters 5 and 8 cover the GEOS and GDAL interface, respectively).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Vector data classes\n",
        "\n",
        "The main classes for working with geographic vector data in Python are hierarchical, meaning the highest level 'vector layer' class is composed of simpler 'geometry column' and individual 'geometry' components.\n",
        "This section introduces them in order, starting with the highest level class.\n",
        "For many applications, the high level vector layer class, which are essentially data frame with geometry columns, are that's needed.\n",
        "However, it's important to understand the structure of vector geographic objects and their component pieces for more advanced applications.\n",
        "The three main vector geographic data classes in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `GeoDataFrame`, a class representing vector layers, with a geometry column (class `GeoSeries`) as one of the columns\n",
        "* `GeoSeries`, a class that is used to represent the geometry column in `GeoDataFrame` objects\n",
        "* `shapely` objects which represent individual geometries such as a point or a polygon\n",
        "\n",
        "The first two classes (`GeoDataFrame` and `GeoSeries`) are defined in **geopandas**.\n",
        "The third class is defined in the **shapely** package, which deals with individual geometries, and is a main dependency of the **geopandas** package.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Vector layers\n",
        "\n",
        "The most commonly used geographic vector data structure is the vector layer.\n",
        "There are several approaches for working with vector layers in Python, ranging from low-level packages (e.g., **osgeo**, **fiona**) to the relatively high-level **geopandas** package that is the focus of this section.\n",

        "\n",
        "The two most notable approaches for working with rasters in Python are provided by the **rasterio** and **xarray** packages.\n",
        "As we will see shortly, they differ in their scope and underlying data models. \n",
        "Specifically, **rasterio** represents rasters as **numpy** arrays associated with a separate object holding the spatial metadata.\n",
        "The **xarray** package, however, represents rasters with the native `DataArray` object, which is an extension of **numpy** array designed to hold axis labels and attributes, in the same object, together with the array of raster values.\n",

        "Both packages are not exhaustive in the same way as **geopandas** is. \n",

        "All projected CRSs are based on a geographic CRS, described in the previous section, and rely on map projections to convert the three-dimensional surface of the Earth into Easting and Northing (x and y) values in a projected CRS.\n",

        "Therefore, some properties of the Earth's surface are distorted in this process, such as area, direction, distance, and shape. \n",
        "A projected coordinate system can preserve only one or two of those properties.\n",
        "Projections are often named based on a property they preserve: equal-area preserves area, azimuthal preserves direction, equidistant preserves distance, and conformal preserves local shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are three main groups of projection types: conic, cylindrical, and planar (azimuthal). \n",
        "In a conic projection, the Earth's surface is projected onto a cone along a single line of tangency or two lines of tangency.\n",
        "Distortions are minimized along the tangency lines and rise with the distance from those lines in this projection.\n",
        "Therefore, it is best suited for maps of mid-latitude areas. \n",
        "A cylindrical projection maps the surface onto a cylinder.\n",
        "This projection could also be created by touching the Earth's surface along a single line of tangency or two lines of tangency.\n",
        "Cylindrical projections are used most often when mapping the entire world. \n",
