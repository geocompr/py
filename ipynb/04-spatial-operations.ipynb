        "Spatial subsetting is the process of taking a spatial object and returning a new object containing only features that relate in space to another object. Analogous to attribute subsetting (covered in @sec-vector-attribute-subsetting), subsets of sf data frames can be created with square bracket ([) operator using the syntax x[y, , op = st_intersects], where x is an sf object from which a subset of rows will be returned, y is the ‘subsetting object’ and , op = st_intersects is an optional argument that specifies the topological relation (also known as the binary predicate) used to do the subsetting. The default topological relation used when an op argument is not provided is st_intersects(): the command x[y, ] is identical to x[y, , op = st_intersects] shown above but not x[y, , op = st_disjoint] (the meaning of these and other topological relations is described in the next section). The filter() function from the tidyverse can also be used but this approach is more verbose, as we will see in the examples below.\n",

        "\n",
        "The term ‘map algebra’ was coined in the late 1970s to describe a “set of conventions, capabilities, and techniques” for the analysis of geographic raster and (although less prominently) vector data (Tomlin 1994). In this context, we define map algebra more narrowly, as operations that modify or summarise raster cell values, with reference to surrounding cells, zones, or statistical functions that apply to every cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "Map algebra operations tend to be fast, because raster datasets only implicitly store coordinates, hence the old adage “raster is faster but vector is corrector”. The location of cells in raster datasets can be calculated by using its matrix position and the resolution and origin of the dataset (stored in the header). For the processing, however, the geographic position of a cell is barely relevant as long as we make sure that the cell position is still the same after the processing. Additionally, if two or more raster datasets share the same extent, projection and resolution, one could treat them as matrices for the processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the way that map algebra works with the terra package. First, the headers of the raster datasets are queried and (in cases where map algebra operations work on more than one dataset) checked to ensure the datasets are compatible. Second, map algebra retains the so-called one-to-one locational correspondence, meaning that cells cannot move. This differs from matrix algebra, in which values change position, for example when multiplying or dividing matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Map algebra (or cartographic modeling with raster data) divides raster operations into four subclasses (Tomlin 1990), with each working on one or several grids simultaneously:\n",
