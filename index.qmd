This is site contains ideas, code and an outline of a yet-to-be written book on *Geocomputation with Python*.

## Motivations


## Reproducing this book
<!-- Would this live better in the README (RL 2022-02-16) -->

An important aspect of scientific research and 'citizen science' that is participatory is reproducibility of results.
We aim to make this web version of the book as easy as possible. See the source code for details (work in progress).

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Todo: improve these instructions before showing these system commands
# To reproduce the book you need Python and and geo packages installed
# Install them through a framework such as Conda (recommended) or pip3 as follows:
pip3 install geopandas rasterio rioxarray jupyter matplotlib netcdf4 h5netcdf 
# install quarto...
quarto preview

# Run the book code on Docker:
docker run --rm -d -p 8784:8787 -e DISABLE_AUTH=TRUE --name geocompy \
  -v $(pwd):/home/rstudio/pytest geocompr/geocompr:python
firefox localhost:8784 # or your browser of choice
```
